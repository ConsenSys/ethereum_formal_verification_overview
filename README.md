# Ethereum Formal Verification

This page tries to give an overview of the formal verification projects in the Ethereum ecosystem, extending and updating https://github.com/pirapira/ethereum-formal-verification-overview.

The focus here is formal verification of smart contracts, while attempting to also gather information about formal verification of protocols and compilers.

The lists are not complete and you are encouraged to visit the project pages to know more about them.

Please do not hesitate and open an issue/PR if you have information not present here or if you find a mistake.

## Compilers

### Solidity

* [Yul-Semantics](https://github.com/ethereum/yul-semantics): Yul is an IR language used by the Solidity compiler
that provides several different optimizers. Yul formal semantics enables equivalence checking between nonoptimized and
optimized versions of the same program.
* [Yul-Isabelle](https://github.com/mmalvarez/Yul-Isabelle). The semantics of the IR Yul formalized in Isabelle.

## Ethereum 2.0

### Phase 0

* [Formal Verification of the Eth2.0 Specs in Dafny](https://github.com/ConsenSys/eth2.0-dafny) The objective of this project is to write a formal specification of the Eth2.0 specification in the verification-aware programming language [Dafny](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/wiki).

* [Fully Mechanised Proof of the Incremental Merkle tree algorithm](https://github.com/ConsenSys/deposit-sc-dafny). The source code in this repository is the **first complete formal proof of correctness** of the incremental Merkle tree algorithm used in the Deposit Smart Contract. 
The proofs and algorithms are written in [Dafny](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/wiki), a verification-friendly programming language.

* [Deposit Contract (Runtime Verification) (part 1)](https://runtimeverification.com/blog/formal-verification-of-ethereum-2-0-deposit-contract-part-1/)
* [Deposit Contract (Runtime Verification) (part 2)](https://runtimeverification.com/blog/end-to-end-formal-verification-of-ethereum-2-0-deposit-smart-contract/)
